OPPENHEIMER*\\nPrinceton University, USA\\nSUMMARY\\nMost texts on writing style encourage authors to avoid overly-complex words. However, a majority\\nof undergraduates admit to deliberately increasing the complexity of their vocabulary so as to give\\nthe impression of intelligence. This paper explores the extent to which this strategy is effective.\\nExperiments 1–3 manipulate complexity of texts and ﬁnd a negative relationship between complex-\\nity and judged intelligence. This relationship held regardless of the quality of the original essay, and\\nirrespective of the participants’ prior expectations of essay quality. The negative impact of\\ncomplexity was mediated by processing ﬂuency. Experiment 4 directly manipulated ﬂuency and\\nfound that texts in hard to read fonts are judged to come from less intelligent authors. Experiment 5\\ninvestigated discounting of ﬂuency. When obvious causes for low ﬂuency exist that are not relevant\\nto the judgement at hand, people reduce their reliance on ﬂuency as a cue; in fact, in an effort not to\\nbe inﬂuenced by the irrelevant source of ﬂuency, they over-compensate and are biased in the opposite\\ndirection. Implications and applications are discussed. Copyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\\nWhen it comes to writing, most experts agree that clarity, simplicity and parsimony are\\nideals that authors should strive for. In their classic manual of style, Strunk and White\\n(1979) encourage authors to ‘omit needless words.’ Daryl Bem’s (1995) guidelines for\\nsubmission to Psychological Bulletin advise, ‘the ﬁrst step towards clarity is writing\\nsimply.’ Even the APA publication manual (1996) recommends, ‘direct, declarative\\nsentences with simple common words are usually best.’\\nHowever, most of us can likely recall having read papers, either by colleagues or\\nstudents, in which the author appears to be deliberately using overly complex words.\\nExperience suggests that the experts’ advice contrasts with prevailing wisdom on how to\\nsound more intelligent as a writer. In fact, when 110 Stanford undergraduates were polled\\nabout their writing habits, most of them admitted that they had made their writing more\\ncomplex in order to appear smarter. For example, when asked, ‘Have you ever changed the\\nwords in an academic essay to make the essay sound more valid or intelligent by using\\ncomplicated language?’ 86.4% of the sample admitted to having done so. Nearly two-\\nthirds answered yes to the question, ‘When you write an essay, do you turn to the thesaurus\\nto choose words that are more complex to give the impression that the content is more\\nvalid or intelligent?’\\nCopyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\\n*Correspondence to: D.

Intelligence and large vocabularies are positively\\ncorrelated (Spearman, 1904). Therefore, by displaying a large vocabulary, one may be\\nproviding cues that he or she is intelligent as well. Secondly, writers are assumed to be\\nconforming to the Gricean maxim of manner, ‘avoid obscurity of expression’ (Grice,\\n1975). If authors are believed to be writing as simply as possible, but a text is nonetheless\\ncomplex, a reader might believe that the ideas expressed in that text are also complex,\\ndefying all attempts to simplify the language. Further, individuals forced to struggle\\nthrough a complex text might experience dissonance if they believe that the ideas being\\nconveyed are simple (Festinger, 1957). Thus, individuals might be motivated to perceive a\\ndifﬁcult text as being more worthwhile, thereby justifying the effort of processing.\\nIndeed, there is some evidence that complex vocabulary can be indicative of a more\\nintelligent author. For example, Penneba ker and King (1999) have shown that the\\npercentage of long words used in class as signments positively correlates with SAT\\nscores and exam grades on both multiple cho ice and essay tests. However it is difﬁcult\\nto draw conclusions about the effectiveness of a strategy of complexity from this data.\\nThe study did not look at how readers of the texts containing the long words perceived\\nthe authors’ intelligence. Thus, it is possi ble that although students using complex\\nvocabularies are objectively very knowledgeable, they might nonetheless be perceived\\nas being less so.\\nWhy might we believe that the experts might be correct in recommending simplicity in\\nwriting? One theory that predicts the effectiveness of straightforward writing is that of\\nprocessing ﬂuency. Simpler writing is easier to process, and studies have demonstrated\\nthat processing ﬂuency is associated with a variety of positive dimensions. Fluency leads\\nto higher judgements of truth (Reber & Schwarz, 1999), conﬁdence (Norwick & Epley,\\n2002), frequency (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973), fame (Jacoby, Kelley, Brown, &\\nJasechko, 1989), and even liking (Reber, Winkielman, & Schwarz, 1998). Furthermore,\\nthe effects of ﬂuency are strongest when the ﬂuency is discrepant—when the amount of\\nexperienced ﬂuency is surprising (Whittlesea & Williams, 2001a, 2001b). As such, it\\nwould not be surprising if the lower ﬂuency of overly complex texts caused readers to have\\nnegative evaluations of those texts and the associated authors, especially if the complexity\\nwas unnecessary and thus surprising readers with the relative disﬂuency of the text.\\nBoth the experts and prevailing wisdom present plausible views, but which (if either) is\\ncorrect? The present paper provides an empirical investigation of the strategy of complex-\\nity, and ﬁnds such a strategy to be unsuccessful. Five studies demonstrate that the loss of\\nﬂuency due to needless complexity in a text negatively impacts raters’ assessments of the\\ntext’s authors.\\nEXPERIMENT 1\\nExperiment 1 aimed to answer several simple questions. First, does increasing the\\ncomplexity of text succeed in making the author appear more intelligent? Second, to\\nwhat extent does the success of this strategy depend on the quality of the original, simpler\\nwriting? Finally, if the strategy is unsuccessful, is the failure of the strategy due to loss of\\nﬂuency? To answer these questions, graduate school admission essays were made more\\ncomplex by substituting some of the original words with their longest applicable thesaurus\\nentries.\\n140 D. M.

First, it is possible that the reason that\\ncomplexity was unsuccessful was that words were misused. In an effort to prevent\\nexperimenter biases from inﬂuencing the data, the word replacement process was\\nalgorithmic, and left little room for human judgement. Although only synonyms of the\\nappropriate linguistic sense were included, and grammatical editing took place, it is\\nnonetheless possible that some of the replacement words were used slightly out of context,\\nor led to awkward sounding sentences.\\nSecondly, the domain of college application essays may lead to biases against the\\nstrategy of complexity. Participants likely are aware of the widespread use of the\\nstrategy—especially in admissions essays—and may be actively discounting the use of\\ncomplex words. Finally, it could be the case that complexity is differentially successful as\\na strategy depending upon a reader’s prior expectation of the author’s intelligence. In\\nExperiment 1, the readers had no reason to think that the authors were particularly\\nintelligent; maybe if the readers had believed the authors to be brilliant at the outset of the\\nexperiment, the presence of complex vocabulary would have reinforced such a belief and\\nled to higher ratings.\\nAs such, a second experiment was run to control for the confounds in Experiment 1 and\\ninvestigate the impact of prior beliefs.\\nEXPERIMENT 2\\nIf actively replacing words in an essay may impair the quality of the text, then to test the\\neffects of complex words we need a more natural set of stimuli. Therefore, for Experiment\\n2 it was necessary to ﬁnd two essays of identical content, but using different vocabulary, in\\nwhich the experimenters did not inﬂuence word selection. Many texts in foreign languages\\nhave multiple translations, which conform to the original meaning of the text, but use\\ndifferent words and grammatical construction. This provides the perfect domain for testing\\nwhether complex phrasing and vocabulary hurts perceptions of a text.\\nFigure 2.

People tend to attribute events to a\\nsingle cause, rather than multiple causes (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1986; Kelley, 1973). Thus,\\nwhen one cause is known to have occurred, people think that other causes are less likely to\\nhave also occurred. This phenomenon applies to the metacognitive experience of ﬂuency\\n(Oppenheimer, 2004; Schwarz, 2004; Whittlesea & Williams, 1998). When obvious\\ncauses for low ﬂuency exist that are not relevant to the judgement that is being made,\\npeople reduce their reliance on ﬂuency as a cue; in fact, in an effort not to be inﬂuenced by\\nthe irrelevant source of ﬂuency, they overcompensate and are biased in the opposite\\ndirection (see Wilson & Brekke, 1994 for a review of overcompensation effects).\\nFor example, Oppenheimer (2004) asked people to make judgements about surname\\nfrequency, a task for which people typically use ﬂuency as a cue (Tversky & Kahneman,\\n1973). In a series of experiments, he showed that in the presence of obvious causes for\\nﬂuency that had no bearing on frequency—such as personal relevance, or a famous\\nindividual associated with that name—people no longer used ﬂuency in making their\\njudgement. In fact, they tended to rate the ﬂuent name as less frequent rather than more\\nfrequent when a salient cause for ﬂuency was available.\\nSpontaneous discounting of ﬂuency suggests that conscious awareness of the source of\\nlow ﬂuency should undermine the effectiveness of the ﬂuency manipulation. In fact, if\\nthere is an obvious cause for lack of ﬂuency the trends might actually reverse as people\\novercompensate in their attempt not to be inﬂuenced by ﬂuency. Experiment 5 investigates\\nthis possibility.\\nEXPERIMENT 5\\nOne method for lowering ﬂuency and making the source of the decreased ﬂuency obvious,\\nis the ‘low toner’ paradigm (Oppenheimer & Frank, under review).

The effect was demonstrated regardless of the quality of the original\\nessay or prior beliefs about a text’s quality. All in all, the effect is extremely robust:\\nneedless complexity leads to negative evaluations.\\nThe results further suggest that this effect is due to lowered processing ﬂuency.\\nExperiment 4 shows that directly reducing ﬂ uency through a standard font manipulation\\n(e.g. Norwick & Epley, 2002) leads to lower intelligence judgements. Further, Experi-\\nment 5 demonstrated that if the source of reduced ﬂuency becomes obvious, partici-\\npants will discount their lack of ﬂuency, whi ch reverses the direction of the effect.\\nMediation analyses in Experi ments 1–3 suggest a similar process is occurring with\\ncomplex vocabulary. However, it is worth noting that although Experiment 1 and\\nExperiment 3 were conceptually very simila r, the results of the mediation analyses\\nvaried in regard to their reliability. This suggests that while ﬂuency clearly inﬂuences\\nintelligence judgements, there are most ce rtainly other factors in play as well. For\\n5One question that arises from this study is what sources are ‘obvious’ enough to elicit spontaneous discounting.\\nA challenge that arises in answering this question, is that how ‘obvious’ the source needs to be varies depending\\non the situation; sources need to be much more salient to elicit discounting when time constraints are imposed,\\nand need be much less so when participants are highly motivated to thoroughly think through their judgements\\n(Oppenheimer & Monin, in prep).

While it is undoubtedly worthwhile to\\nidentify and empirically investigate these other factors, doing so is beyond the scope of\\nthis paper. At this point, however, one can c onclude that ﬂuency clearly is at least\\npartially responsible for the effect, and s ince longer words lower ﬂuency they can have\\na negative impact on intelligence judgements.\\nHowever, one cannot conclude from these results that using long words is always\\nproblematic. For one thing, the population tested in these studies is extremely limited.\\nStanford students are both well educated and motivated; it is possible that this pattern of\\nresults was found only because participants were able to understand the complex\\nvocabulary, and made the effort to muddle through to the content beneath. Similarly,\\none could imagine that experts in a given ﬁeld (who are more familiar with the jargon)\\nwould react differently to simpliﬁed essays than novices. For one, the experts would ﬁnd\\nthe jargon a great deal more ﬂuent than non-experts. Additionally, a lack of jargon might\\nbe a signal that the author is not an in-group member of the ﬁeld; this could lead to\\nsimpliﬁed writing being negatively associated with intelligence. Thus, further research is\\nnecessary to determine if these results generalize to the population as a whole.\\nAnother limitation is that these studies exclusively examined written text; it is unclear\\nwhether the same effects would apply to oral conversation as well. Finally, there are many\\ntimes when a long word is appropriate, because it is more precise or concise. These studies\\nprimarily investigated the use of needless complexity in writing. When a long word is\\nactually the best word for the occasion, it very well may be that using it will lead to\\npositive appraisals. Indeed, these studies can not rule out the possibility that in some\\nsituations judicious use of a thesaurus will improve the quality of writing. A thesaurus\\ncould be used to help select the most appropriate word for a given argument such that\\ndecreases in ﬂuency are overridden by increases by other positive attributes of a given\\nword substitution.\\nIt is also worth examining potential boundary conditions of the effect. While the present\\nstudies have primarily investigated the impact of complexity on intelligence judgements, it\\nseems possible that other dimensions such as liking, sociability or trustworthiness could be\\nimpacted as well. Likely, the extent to which other dimensions are impacted will be related\\nto people’s naı¨ ve theories of how ﬂuency is related to those dimensions (Schwarz, 2004).\\nIf people tend to believe that ﬂuency is positively correlated with sociability, then\\nincreasing complexity of a text should lead to lower judgements of the author’s sociability.\\nAlternatively, if people tend to believe that ﬂuency is negatively correlated with\\nsociability, then ﬂuency would have the opposite effect on judgement. This leads to the\\nintriguing possibility that if participants could somehow be primed to think that disﬂuent\\ntext tended to come from more intelligent authors, one would expect the results from this\\nset of studies to reverse.\\nHowever, it seems that people’s naı¨ ve theories of ﬂuency tend to lead them to negatively\\nassociate complexity and intelligence. This has some interesting ramiﬁcations. The most\\nstraightforward of these is that authors should avoid needless complexity. As reported in\\nthe introduction of this paper, a vast majority of Stanford students use a strategy of\\ncomplexity when writing papers and this is undoubtedly true at campuses and businesses\\nacross the country. However, this research shows that such strategies tend to backﬁre. This\\nﬁnding could be broadly applied to help people improve their writing, and receive more\\npositive evaluations of their work.\\n152 D. M. Oppenheimer\\nCopyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Experiment 4 directly manipulated ﬂuency and\\nfound that texts in hard to read fonts are judged to come from less intelligent authors. Experiment 5\\ninvestigated discounting of ﬂuency. When obvious causes for low ﬂuency exist that are not relevant\\nto the judgement at hand, people reduce their reliance on ﬂuency as a cue; in fact, in an effort not to\\nbe inﬂuenced by the irrelevant source of ﬂuency, they over-compensate and are biased in the opposite'),\n",

In their classic manual of style, Strunk and White\\n(1979) encourage authors to ‘omit needless words.’ Daryl Bem’s (1995) guidelines for\\nsubmission to Psychological Bulletin advise, ‘the ﬁrst step towards clarity is writing\\nsimply.’ Even the APA publication manual (1996) recommends, ‘direct, declarative\\nsentences with simple common words are usually best.’\\nHowever, most of us can likely recall having read papers, either by colleagues or\\nstudents, in which the author appears to be deliberately using overly complex words.\\nExperience suggests that the experts’ advice contrasts with prevailing wisdom on how to\\nsound more intelligent as a writer. In fact, when 110 Stanford undergraduates were polled\\nabout their writing habits, most of them admitted that they had made their writing more\\ncomplex in order to appear smarter. For example, when asked, ‘Have you ever changed the\\nwords in an academic essay to make the essay sound more valid or intelligent by using\\ncomplicated language?’ 86.4% of the sample admitted to having done so. Nearly two-\\nthirds answered yes to the question, ‘When you write an essay, do you turn to the thesaurus'),\n",

Intelligence and large vocabularies are positively\\ncorrelated (Spearman, 1904). Therefore, by displaying a large vocabulary, one may be\\nproviding cues that he or she is intelligent as well. Secondly, writers are assumed to be\\nconforming to the Gricean maxim of manner, ‘avoid obscurity of expression’ (Grice,\\n1975). If authors are believed to be writing as simply as possible, but a text is nonetheless\\ncomplex, a reader might believe that the ideas expressed in that text are also complex,\\ndefying all attempts to simplify the language. Further, individuals forced to struggle\\nthrough a complex text might experience dissonance if they believe that the ideas being\\nconveyed are simple (Festinger, 1957). Thus, individuals might be motivated to perceive a\\ndifﬁcult text as being more worthwhile, thereby justifying the effort of processing.\\nIndeed, there is some evidence that complex vocabulary can be indicative of a more\\nintelligent author. For example, Penneba ker and King (1999) have shown that the\\npercentage of long words used in class as signments positively correlates with SAT\\nscores and exam grades on both multiple cho ice and essay tests.

One theory that predicts the effectiveness of straightforward writing is that of\\nprocessing ﬂuency. Simpler writing is easier to process, and studies have demonstrated\\nthat processing ﬂuency is associated with a variety of positive dimensions. Fluency leads\\nto higher judgements of truth (Reber & Schwarz, 1999), conﬁdence (Norwick & Epley,\\n2002), frequency (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973), fame (Jacoby, Kelley, Brown, &\\nJasechko, 1989), and even liking (Reber, Winkielman, & Schwarz, 1998). Furthermore,\\nthe effects of ﬂuency are strongest when the ﬂuency is discrepant—when the amount of\\nexperienced ﬂuency is surprising (Whittlesea & Williams, 2001a, 2001b). As such, it\\nwould not be surprising if the lower ﬂuency of overly complex texts caused readers to have\\nnegative evaluations of those texts and the associated authors, especially if the complexity\\nwas unnecessary and thus surprising readers with the relative disﬂuency of the text.\\nBoth the experts and prevailing wisdom present plausible views, but which (if either) is'),\n",

People tend to attribute events to a\\nsingle cause, rather than multiple causes (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1986; Kelley, 1973). Thus,\\nwhen one cause is known to have occurred, people think that other causes are less likely to\\nhave also occurred. This phenomenon applies to the metacognitive experience of ﬂuency\\n(Oppenheimer, 2004; Schwarz, 2004; Whittlesea & Williams, 1998). When obvious\\ncauses for low ﬂuency exist that are not relevant to the judgement that is being made,\\npeople reduce their reliance on ﬂuency as a cue; in fact, in an effort not to be inﬂuenced by\\nthe irrelevant source of ﬂuency, they overcompensate and are biased in the opposite\\ndirection (see Wilson & Brekke, 1994 for a review of overcompensation effects).\\nFor example, Oppenheimer (2004) asked people to make judgements about surname\\nfrequency, a task for which people typically use ﬂuency as a cue (Tversky & Kahneman,\\n1973). In a series of experiments, he showed that in the presence of obvious causes for\\nﬂuency that had no bearing on frequency—such as personal relevance, or a famous'),\n",

In fact, they tended to rate the ﬂuent name as less frequent rather than more\\nfrequent when a salient cause for ﬂuency was available.\\nSpontaneous discounting of ﬂuency suggests that conscious awareness of the source of\\nlow ﬂuency should undermine the effectiveness of the ﬂuency manipulation. In fact, if\\nthere is an obvious cause for lack of ﬂuency the trends might actually reverse as people\\novercompensate in their attempt not to be inﬂuenced by ﬂuency.

However, the cause of the lack of\\nﬂuency is immediately obvious to anybody who has ever observed a low toner document.\\nBecause the reason for the low ﬂuency will be obvious to participants, a ﬂuency account\\nwould predict that people would discount their lack of ﬂuency.

Pennebaker and Lay\\n(2002) have shown that people are more likely to use big words when they are feeling the\\nmost insecure.

Likewise leaders\\nfacing crucial decisions might use more complex vocabulary and end up undermining\\nothers’ conﬁdence in their leadership ability.
